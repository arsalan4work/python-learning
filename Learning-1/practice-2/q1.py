# Q1: Explain the difference between a list and a tuple in Python. 
# In what scenarios would you prefer to use a tuple over a list?

# Ans: 1. List are mutable and tuple and not mutable.
# 2. Tuple are more faster than list because they have fixed values. Lists cannot be used as dictionary keys because they are mutable
# 3. Use of list when nedd to modify, sort, update data frequently and use tuples when data remain constant
