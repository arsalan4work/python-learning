# Loops 
# For loop: A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like list, tuple, or string [iterables] 

# for i in range(1,6): #specify range(start, stop, step_size)
#    print(i)


# l = [1, "Arsalan", False, "Bilal", "Ahmed"]
# i = 0
# while(i<len(l)):
#    print(l[i])
#    i += 1

# For loop with list
# l1 = [1,4,6,7,8,9,0]
# for i in l1:
#    print(i)

# For loop with Tuple
# t = (6,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
# for i in t:
#    print(i)

# For loop with String
# name = "Arsalan"
# for i in name:
#    print(i)

# l = [1,7,8]
# for item in l:
#    print(item)
# else:
#    print("Done")

# for i in range(1,100):
#    print(i)
#    if i == 5:
#       break #exit the loop

# l = ["Arsalan", "Ali", "Ahmed", "Bilal", "Hassan", "Zohaib"]
# for i in l:
#    if i == "Ahmed":
#       continue #skip this iteration
#    print(i)

# dic = {
#    "name1": "Arsalan",
#    "name2": "Ahmed",
#    "name3": "Ali",
#    "name4": "Hassan",
# }

# # for i in dic:
# #    if dic[i] == "Ali":
# #       continue #skip this iteration
# #    print(i)

# for i in dic:
#    if dic[i] == "Ali":
#       break 
#    print(i)

# l = [1,2,3,4]
# for i in l:
#    pass # pass is a null statement in python.
