# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers.
# a = 2
# b = 2
# print(a + b)


# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.
# a = 3
# b = 2
# z = (a % b)
# print(z)


# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.
# a = input("Enter something: ")
# print(type(a))


# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than
#    ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80
# a = 34
# b = 80
# print(a > b)


# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
# inp1 = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
# inp2 = int(input("Enter number 2: "))
# print((inp1 + inp2) / 2)

# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

# a = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
# print(a ** 2)
